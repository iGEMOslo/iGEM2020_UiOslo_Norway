#parametersForModel rules:
#1. all comments must start with #
#2. all parameters must be on their own line without any #
#3. all parameters must be on the form x=5, with an equality sign
#4. parameter names are sensitive, do not change them
#5. booleans are represented as true or false, for example bol=true
